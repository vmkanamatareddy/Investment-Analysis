# Investment-Analysis-Exploratory Data Analysis
An Investment company  wants to invest in countries with the highest amount of funding for the chosen investment type. This is a part of its broader strategy to invest where most investments are occurring.

The business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward.

Business objective: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:
Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be our favourites.
Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)


Firm wants to see the top nine countries which have received the highest total funding (across ALL sectors for the chosen investment type)
For the chosen investment type, make a data frame named top9 with the top nine countries (based on the total investment amount each country has received)
Identify the top three English-speaking countries in the data frame top9.
